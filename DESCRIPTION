Description: ready4use provides a set of classes and
    methods for general data management tasks throughout the ready4 suite
    of tools for mental health data synthesis and modelling projects.
    This development version of the ready4use package has been made
    available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
    package. The tools contained in this development release automate a
    number of tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL
    MACHINE.  Therefore you should only trial this software if you feel
    confident that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit
    area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any
    questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).

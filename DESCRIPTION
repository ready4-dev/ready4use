Description: ready4use provides a set of tools for general data management
    tasks when developping open source, modular mental health simulation
    models.  This development version of the ready4use package has been
    made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
    package.  You should only trial this software if you feel confident
    that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in
    which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions,
    please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).

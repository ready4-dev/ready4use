Description: ready4use provides a set of classes and methods for general
    data management tasks throughout the ready4 suite of tools for mental
    health data synthesis and modelling projects.  This development
    version of the ready4use package has been made available as part of
    the process of testing and documenting the package. The tools
    contained in this development release automate a number of tasks which
    MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore you
    should only trial this software if you feel confident that you
    understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you
    can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).

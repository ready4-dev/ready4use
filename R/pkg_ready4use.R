#' Data in Projects Developed with the Ready4 Suite
#'
#' ready4use provides a set of classes and
#' methods for general data management tasks throughout the ready4 suite
#' of tools for mental health data synthesis and modelling projects.
#' This development version of the ready4use package has been made
#' available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
#' package. The tools contained in this development release automate a
#' number of tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL
#' MACHINE.  Therefore you should only trial this software if you feel
#' confident that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit
#' area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any
#' questions, please contact the authors

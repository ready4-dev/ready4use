#' MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  While we
#' welcome and appreciate anyone who takes the time to provide us with
#' feedback on this test release, we caution you that you should only
#' test this software if you feel confident you understand what it does
#' and have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake
#' testing. If you have any questions, please contact the authors

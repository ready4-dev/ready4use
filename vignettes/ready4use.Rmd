The tools in ready4use are designed to make it easier to prepare, supply and share data for use with [ready4 - an open source health economic model of the systems shaping mental health and wellbeing in young people](https://www.ready4-dev.com).

This development version of the ready4use package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. 

A brief overview of the intended use of ready4use classes and methods is available in the following articles:
